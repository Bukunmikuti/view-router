 npm i @bukunmikuti/view-router
 ```

</details>
 
 # Set up üöÄ
 View router exposes a single object: ```ViewRouter``` where you can pass your options.
 
 ```javascript
 const viewrouter = new ViewRouter(options)
 ```

 Instantiate the class by passing an object parameter which must include ```views: []``` and other optional properties.
 
 ```javascript
 const viewrouter = new ViewRouter({
	views: [], //required
	navigation: "history"||"hash",
	transition: true||false, 
})
 ```

 
## ```views: []```
<details>
<summary>see details ‚û°Ô∏è</summary>
<br>

 ```Type:``` Array of objects ‚Äî required <br>
 ```Description:``` This property stores each view's property in an object. It can contain several view definitions.
 
 ```javascript
 const viewrouter = new ViewRouter({
	views: [
		{
			id: "login", //required
			path: "/login",
			origin: "/login.html",
			mounted() {}, //callback
			render() {} //callback
		},
		
		{/* another view */}
		{/* another view */}
	]
})
 ```
 A view definition should include the following properties:
