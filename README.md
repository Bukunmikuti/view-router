 ## Installation
 ### NPM
 ```
 npm i @bukunmikuti/view-router
 ```
 ### \<script> Include 
 ```html
 <script src="cdn"></script>
 ```
 ### ES Module
 ```javascript
 import ViewRouter from "cdn"
 ```
 
 ## Set up üõ∞Ô∏è
 View router exposes a single object: ```ViewRouter``` where you can pass your options.
 
 ```javascript
 const viewrouter = new ViewRouter(options)
 ```

 This class should be instantiated by passing an object which must include ```views: []``` and other optional properties.
 
 ```javascript
 const viewrouter = new ViewRouter({
	views: [], //required
	navigation: "history"||"hash",
	transitions: true||false, 
})
 ```
 ### Property: ```views: []```
 ```Type:``` Array of objects [{...}] ‚Äî required <br>
 ```Description:``` This property stores each view's property in an object. It can contain several view definitions.
 
 ```javascript
 const viewrouter = new ViewRouter({
	views: [
		{
			id: "login", //required
			path: "/login",
			origin: "/login.html",
			mounted() {}, //callback
			render() {} //callback
		},
		
		{/* another view */}
		{/* another view */}
	]
})
 ```
 A view definition should include the following properties:
 
 | View property | Description | Default Value |
| :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| ```id``` | The 'id' attribute of the template tag ‚Äî Required| undefined |
| ```path``` | The URL path that triggers the view when navigated to. | undefined |
| ```origin``` | If the view is located in another html document, this will contain the relative path to the document. | undefined |
| ```mounted``` | Views are not part of the DOM by default, they only get mounted when routed to for the first time. Put any logic that depends on accessing elements of the view here. It is called only once | callback undefined |
| ```render``` | This method is called each time a view is routed to | callback undefined |

 ### Property: ```navigation```
 ```Type:``` String ‚Äî history or hash (optional) <br>
 ```Description:``` Make router use hash navigation or Web history API. If undefined or false then routing is automatically disabled, else ```views: [{path: ""}]``` must be specified.
 
  ### Property: ```transitions```
 ```Type:``` Boolean ‚Äî optional<br>
 ```Description:``` Enable or disable view transitions. Transition type must be specified on the view ```<template>``` tag. <br>All transitions ‚Äî ```fadeIn``` ```fadeInTop``` ```fadeInBottom``` ```fadeInLeft``` ```fadeInRight```
 
 ```html
 <!--index.html-->
 <template id="login" class="v-router fadeInLeft"></template>
 
 <script type="module">
 import ViewRouter from "..."
 
 let v = new ViewRouter({
  //...
  transitions: true
 })
 </script>
 
 ```
 ### Methods
