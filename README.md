 # Roadmap ðŸš§
 Roadmap and checklist for v1.1.1 release
 
 - [x] Make current view 'disappear' or go off screen if back button is pressed and there is no view to nativage to. <br><br>
 **Current behaviour:** The browser does nothing when back button is clicked and exits page on second click <br><br>
 **Expected behaviour:** To remove current view from screen by making it disappear <br><br>
 **Caveat:** When a template is the base view, clicking back to remove it from screen might not be user friendly
 - [ ] refine Lifecycle hooks to help handle views entry and exit more effectively. 
 - > **proposed Lifecycle hooks:** <br> beforeEnter() <br> onEnter() <br> beforeLeave() <br> onLeave()
 - [ ] create ```v.animate()``` method to manipulate default transitions in Lifecycle hooks. The other option is to use HTML attributes to specify in and out animations. 



 # Updates ðŸš€
 v1.1.1 updates - Two new methods 
 
## ```start```<br>
Description: Make ViewRouter navigates to the url path on page load. This function accepts a callback function which takes just one argument which is the view ID of the url path. It is defined outside the ```new ViewRouter()``` instance.<br>

> **Note:** You can call ```routeTo()``` inside callback function to navigate to your base/default view if the callback function returns undefined (that is, path on page load does not exist). 

## ```notFound()```<br>
Description: Defines ViewRouter behaviour if requested url path does not exist in ```views:[]```. This method executes a callback function which accepts two arguments
		- ```previous path``` (optional): The former path where the navigation comes from
		- ```current path``` (optional): The unmatched and non-existent view path.
		<br>
	This function executes whenever there is a navigation to an unmatched path. 

> **Note:** You cannot call ```routeTo()``` inside this callback. To navigate to a 404 view or any other view, you must return the view ID instead. For example ```return "404"``` navigates to a 404 view. <br> ```return true``` or ```undefined```, takes the current view out of the screen while ```return false``` leaves the view on screen. 

## Breaking Changes
- removed ```transition``` property
- view router is now distributed in two build: default build (with transitions) and core build (excluding all transitions)
> **Note:** <br> Default build comes with all transition classes prebundled while the core build defines only view router main functionality. You can use the ```viewrouter.css``` file in the distribution to include transitions seperately or use a different animation library to handle transitions.
